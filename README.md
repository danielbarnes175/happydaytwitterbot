# Happy Day Twitter Bot
A Twitter bot that randomly generates what's special about the day.

To randomly generate the "happy day" it uses the formula "Happy" + adjective + noun + abstract noun + "Day!"

It sends out a tweet once every 24 hours. [Here](https://twitter.com/HappyDayBot2) is  a link to the Twitter account. Go give it a follow!

# Contributing
One easy way to contribute would be to help expand upon the list of abstract nouns. I had to make that list myself because I couldn't find any lists out there that had a lot and were easily accessible, so it is a little short.

An abstract noun is as follows: a noun denoting an idea, quality, or state rather than a concrete object.

# Requests or Ideas
For any requests or if you have an idea, feel free to create a GitHub issue. I don't have a particular format for this project as it's not too in depth, so suggest away!
